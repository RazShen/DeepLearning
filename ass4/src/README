Obtain the Data:
    Download pre-trained word vectors and SNLI_1.0 (train, dev and test data):
        step 1) sudo chmod +x setup.sh
        step 2) ./setup.sh
        step 3) make sure glove.6B.200d.txt exists
        (if not, download it manually from https://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip)
        step 4) make sure snli_1.0 folder exists with the files:
            snli_1.0_dev.jsonl
            snli_1.0_dev.txt
            snli_1.0_test.jsonl
            snli_1.0_test.txt
            snli_1.0_train.jsonl
            snli_1.0_train.txt
        (if not, download it manually from https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/snli_1.0.zip)

Run the model:
    step 1) First make sure that in the running folder there are the files:
        1) ass_4_snli.py
        2) SNLIModel.py
        3) utils.py
        4) glove.6B.200d.txt
        5) snli_1.0 folder with its files as described above.

    step 2) Run the model:

        python ass_4_snli.py

    While the model is running you can see the results per each 100 batches,
    after the model has finished learning 2 graphs with the learning curves will be printed.
